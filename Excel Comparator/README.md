# Excel Comparator

## Description

This project was for a person in Libya to help him with some of his work tasks. The idea of the program is as follows:

The program will take the first and second files, and only one column from the common columns between the files will be selected for comparison. It will then extract 3 files:

1. The first file will contain the rows that exist in the first file but not in the second file.
2. The second file will contain the rows that exist in the second file but not in the first file.
3. The third file will contain the data that is repeated in both files.

The third file will include some data such as: the person's name, the bank's name, the job number, and the estimated amount.

The program will read the second file on the second screen and extract all available bank names. At that point, the user will be able to extract all the names of individuals associated with any bank, calculate their total amounts, and extract that information into a Word file.
